# projectCarPlateDetection

The main idea of the projectt is to automate the car plate detection. For this, we propose the method called “contour-plate” using a set of techniques for generating the mask image from the original image and then iterate all these operations in all the "raw data (original images)" in order to create the dataset. The “contour-plate” method is first applied to a small set of images to see how it works and as an investigation and then be applied to all images.
